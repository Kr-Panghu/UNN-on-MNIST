# UNN-on-MNIST

This is a repository for UNN-on-MNIST.

You can check my codes in .ipynb file (as you can see, I load them from google colab, it's because that it cost a lot of resource, so GPU speedup is in need)

You can check the result (visualization graphs) in the directory "Output"

You can reach the paper: "岑康瑞 Using information theoretic metrics to study the importance of individual neurons in DNNs.pdf"

You can check "论文介绍slides.pdf" to get a fast understanding of my lab.

If any problem, you can contact with me directly at kr2256671169@sjtu.edu.cn
